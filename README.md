The idea for a compressible aerodynamics calculator in the form an online JS tool has been implemented by [William Devenport](http://www.aoe.vt.edu/people/faculty.php?fac_id=wdevenpo) [here](http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3114/calc.html). This project is an pushing in more functionalities as an offline tool and allowing users to dynamically use the formulae for specific cases.
