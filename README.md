Compressible Aerodynamics Calculator for Python
-----------------------------------------------
A python package for compressible flows. A dynamic toolkit which enables you to make use of the formulae governing compressible flows.

*Uses*
* Command-line tool **caeroc-app** which opens a GUI calculator
* Plotting graphs
* Generate gas tables
* Calculate flow characteristics: Coefficient of pressure, lift and drag for basic profiles.

These basic functions can be extended to more complex problems, using the same formulae.

Command-line utility: caeroc-app

The idea for a compressible aerodynamics calculator in the form an online JS tool had been implemented by [William Devenport](http://www.aoe.vt.edu/people/faculty.php?fac_id=wdevenpo) [here](http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3114/calc.html). 
This project is pushing more functionalities as an offline tool and allowing users to dynamically use the formulae for specific cases.
