:Version: 0.0.2a

A python package for compressible flows. A dynamic toolkit which enables you to make use of the formulae governing compressible flows.

Features
--------
* Command-line tool **caeroc-app** which opens a GUI calculator

Objectives
----------
* Save data as a database
* Plotting graphs
* Generate gas tables
* Calculate flow characteristics: Coefficient of pressure, lift and drag for basic profiles.

* The idea for a compressible aerodynamics calculator in the form an online JS tool had been implemented by [William Devenport](http://www.aoe.vt.edu/people/faculty.php?fac_id=wdevenpo) [here](http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3114/calc.html). 
This project is pushing more functionalities as an offline tool and allowing users to dynamically use the formulae for specific cases.
* Thanks to the scikit-aero team for being the backend
